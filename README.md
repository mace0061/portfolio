# My Portfolio Website

## About
The creation of this website was relatively straightforward. I went through a step by step design process from sticky notes to site maps all the way to a functional wireframe in adobe Xd. My biggest challenge was getting things to appear just the right way on my website in accordance with the planned design, but nothing gave too much trouble. A few things I ended up tweaking a bit for the final website, like the background areas of some of my work examples, and the arrangement of the skills area. I definitely learned a lot about how to use Bootstrap, since this was my first major project involving it, and I found it to be an incredibly useful tool and something I look forward to using more in the future.
